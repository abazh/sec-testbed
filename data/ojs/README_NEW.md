# OJS Directory - No Longer Used

This directory was previously used for Open Journal Systems (OJS) files, but the victim container now runs OWASP Juice Shop instead.

The testbed has been simplified to use:
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: A modern vulnerable web application on port 3000
- No external file mounts required
- Self-contained application

This directory can be safely removed or ignored.
